# LM Studio

LM Studio allows users to locally host open-source models available in [their model catalog](https://lmstudio.ai/models). 
It also provides a web portal with a ChatGPT-like interface.
Once an LM Studio instance is locally running in your setup (default `http://localhost:1234`), you can use the `aisuite` API for chat completions as shown below.
No API Key is needed for these locally hosted models.

## Create a Chat Completion

Sample code:
```python
import aisuite as ai

def main():
    # Set the API URL to remote NGA2 server
    client = ai.Client(
        provider_configs={
            "lmstudio": {
                "api_url": "http://localhost:1234",
                "timeout": 300,
            }
        }
    )
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "Be verbose"
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Tell me something about University of Michigan's CSE department."
        },
    ]

    lmstudio_llama = "lmstudio:llama-3.2-3b-instruct"

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=lmstudio_llama, 
        messages=messages, 
        temperature=0.75,
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can expect a response like the following:
